By aggregating the results of  the independant simulations, The Law of Large numbers ensures that the empirical mean of the samples converge to the true theoretical mean (expected value) of the system  $n \\to \\infty$.\n",

This means that is a simulation of an entire set is run $n$ simulations infinite times, than the average of our estimates would be equal to the true answer\n",

    "- The variance of the monte carlo estimator measures how much the estimate fluctuates around the true mean. it is derived from the variance of a single simulation divided by the sample size. **For Example** to reduce the varience of the estimate by a factor of `10` , the number of simulations $n$ need to increase by a factor of `100`\n",
